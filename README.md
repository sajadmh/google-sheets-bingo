To view the script, go to Extensions > Apps Script or view the file in the directory.

Instructions:

1. Duplicate and rename a sheet for each player
2. List your Bingo values in the Settings sheet under the "List of Options" section
3. Uncheck and check the box under "Generate New Cards"
4. All sheets will include a "Free Space" square. To remove, uncheck the "Free Space" box in Settings, then generate all new cards.
5. To reset one player's sheet, as opposed to all sheets, insert a checkbox in the top left corner cell of their sheet and check the box.
6. During gameplay, have players fill their bingo cards by entering "1" (or a number above) in the mini-card in the top right corner of their sheet. To reset the fill, enter "999" where needed.
