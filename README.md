Play Bingo live on Google Sheets with Google Apps Script.


# [Make a copy of the Google Sheet here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pyIqQHvCQLVdCQ8sF_U8VKbcVHL5Ew_7oP2cW-nYgSI/copy)


To view the script, go to Extensions > Apps Script or view the file in the directory.

Instructions:

1. Make a copy of the spreadsheet linked above
2. Duplicate and rename a sheet for each player
3. In the Settings sheet under the "List of Options" section, list your Bingo values
4. Uncheck and check the box under "Generate New Cards" to randomize the values into each player's card/sheet
5. All sheets will include a "Free Space" square. To remove, uncheck the "Free Space" box in Settings, then generate all new cards again

Tip:

* To generate all new values for one player's sheet, as opposed to all sheets, insert a checkbox in the top left corner cell of their sheet and check the box
* During gameplay, have players fill their bingo cards by entering "1" (or a number above) in the mini-card in the top right corner of their sheet. To reset the fill, enter "999" in place of the "1"
